**TATHU** is a Python package for tracking and analyzing the life cycle of **Convective Systems (CS)**.

The package provides a modular and extensible structure, supports different types of geospatial data and proposes the use of **Geoinformatics
techniques** and **spatial databases** in order to aid in the analysis and computational representation of the CS.

**Convective Systems (CS)** are defined as an organized ensemble of thunderstorm clusters and are associated with severe weather events and natural disasters (hail, lightning, precipitation extremes, high winds, among others). Thus, several works propose automatic methods for **monitoring** these elements in order to provide, for each individual CS, characteristics that can describe its **spatio-temporal** evolution, i.e. the life cycle.
